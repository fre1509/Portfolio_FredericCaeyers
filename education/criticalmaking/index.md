## Five of my favorite assignments for the Critical Making class

**Selfie**
-   See the full assignment on this [link](https://fredericcaeyers.artstation.com/projects/VJOa3X).
For this assignment, I had to create a metaphorical selfie that shows who I am.
Here is the final painting I made:

**Comic**
-   For our second assignment, we had to make a comic. I decided to make one based on an event that happened that specific day. More specifically about me drawing the comic. Being inspired by Inception (2006) I created comicception.
Here is the final result:

**Dark Ride Generator**
-   For those of you who know me, know that I love theme parks. So when we needed to make a paragraph generator for this class, I knew I wanted to create a dark ride concept generator. 
You can try the generator our yourself by clicking this [link](https://fre1509.itch.io/dark-ride-concept-generator)


**Hypertext Game**
-   One of the other assignments required us to make a text based game using Twine. Once again I based it on theme parks, but this time on my day off deciding what to do. It also showcases the struggles of not having a car in Florida.
You can play the game for yourself [here](https://fre1509.itch.io/a-day-off)


**Narrative Game**
-   My favorite assignment for this class was when we needed to create a narrative based game alongside AI. I used Copilot and ChatGPT to help me make a breakout game based on the movie 300 (2006). Copilot generated background art while ChatGPT helped me make the game functional.
