## About Me

From when I was a child, I was always in love with movies and theme parks. I
always tagged along with my mother to as many theme parks and amusements
parks as possible as well as cinemas and film festivals.
I got the opportunity to study in France on a study exchange for 3D Animation &
VFX while studying 3D Production & VFX and Look Development in Belgium.

For my master degree, I have been the pioneer on a partnership between two universities in Flanders, Belgium and Quebec, Canada.
I am a 3D/2D artist with a focus on 3D Modelling, texuring and rendering.

Currently I am studying a PhD in Text & Technology at UCF in Orlando, Florida
